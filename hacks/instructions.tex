\section*{Introduction}

Hack session activities are small weekly programming assignments 
intended to get you started on full programming assignments.  
You may complete the hack on your own, but you are \emph{highly encouraged}
to work with another student and form a hack pair.  Groups larger than
2 are not allowed.  However, you may discuss the problems \emph{at a 
high level} with other students or groups.  You may not share code
directly.  

If you choose to form a Hack Pair, you \emph{must}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Both join a hack pair on Canvas (go to People then Hack Pairs)
  \item You must both work on the hack equally; it must be an equal effort
  by both partners.  Do not undermine your partner's learning opportunity and
  do not undermine your own by allowing one parter to do all the work.
  \item Turn in only one copy of the code under the individual whose last
  name comes first (with respect to Canvas).
\end{enumerate}

You are graded based on style, documentation, design and correctness.
For detail, see the general course rubric.
