Correctness:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 8 points on the array part, 2 for the first test suite, 6 for the second
  \item 8 points for the image part, 2 points for each test suite all proportional
\end{itemize}

\section*{Exercises}

To get more practice working with arrays, you will write several 
functions that involve operations on arrays.  In particular, implement
the following functions.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Write a function that, given an integer array and an integer 
  $x$ determines if the array contains $x$ anywhere within the array.
  It should return true if it does, false otherwise.
  
  \mintinline{c}{int contains(const int *arr, int size, int x);}

  \item Write a function that, given an integer array and an integer 
  $x$, determines if the array contains $x$ within the range of the two provided indices $ i\;and\; j $ (including both indices).
  It should return true if it does, false otherwise.

  
  \mintinline{c}{int containsWithin(const int *arr, int size, int x, int i, int j);}
  
  \item Write a function that, given an array of integers, its size and a
  ``new size'' creates a new deep copy of the array.  However, instead of
  its original size, the new array should be of the new size.  If the new
  size is less than the old size, only the first \mintinline{c}{newSize} 
  elements should be copied over.  If the new size is greater than the original
  size, then the new array should be padded out with zeros.
  
  \mintinline{c}{int * paddedCopy(const int *arr, int oldSize, int newSize);}

  \item Write a function that, given an array of integers and its size, 
  reverses the elements in the array.  For example, if the original array
  was \mintinline{c}{[10, 15, 5, 25, 0]} the new array should be 
  \mintinline{c}{[0, 25, 5, 15, 10]}.
  
  \mintinline{c}{void reverse(int *arr, int size);}

  \item Write a similar function that creates and returns a new copy of 
  the given array but with its elements in reverse order. 
  
  \mintinline{c}{int * reverseCopy(const int *arr, int size);}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Image Manipulation}

You'll get more practice with 2-dimensional arrays by writing several
functions to manipulate images.  We've adapted a C image library, the 
``stb'' library, and written several \emph{wrapper functions} to load
and save images.  Wrapper functions are functions that call other
functions but may have some ``glue code'' to make the control flow or
data compatible.  In this case, our wrapper functions convert/translate
the stb library's image representation into an RGB pixel representation.
We've defined a \mintinline{c}{Pixel} structure that holds 3 integer
values one for each of the red, green, and blue color values.  We'll
cover structures in detail later on, but it won't prevent you from working
with them.  

You can declare and use a \mintinline{c}{Pixel} type like you would 
an \mintinline{c}{int} or \mintinline{c}{double}: 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{minted}{c}
//a single pixel:
Pixel p;
//an array of n pixels:
Pixel *p = (Pixel *) malloc(sizeof(Pixel) * n);

//swap two pixels:
Pixel a, b;
...
Pixel temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;
\end{minted} 
\end{figure}

An $h \times w$ (height by width) image can be represented as a two dimensional
array of \mintinline{c}{Pixel} types; in particular: \mintinline{c}{Pixel **image}.
Everything we've covered using two dimensional arrays of \mintinline{c}{int} types
applies to \mintinline{c}{Pixel} types.

We've provided a library of functions to load and save a file (you'll need to 
RTM) and specified several function signatures for functions you need to
implement.  
\begin{itemize}
  \item \mintinline{c}{copyImage()} should produce a deep copy of the given
  image.

  \item \mintinline{c}{flipHorizontal()} should flip the image horizontally
  as depicted in Figure \ref{image:pointersHFlip}.  

  \item \mintinline{c}{flipVertical()} should flip the image vertically as
  depicted in Figure \ref{image:pointersVFlip}.

  \item \mintinline{c}{rotateClockwise()} should produce a new image that
  is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.  This function must produce a new image
  because an $h \times w$ sized image that has been rotated will be a 
  $w \times h$ image.  This operation is depicted in Figure \ref{image:pointersRotated}.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Instructions}

\begin{itemize}

  \item We have provided some starter code in the following project that
  you can clone:
  
  \url{https://github.com/cbourke/CSCE155-Hack7.0}

  \item For the warm-up, place all your function prototypes into a file 
  named \mintinline{text}{array_utils.h} and and their definitions in a
  file named \mintinline{text}{array_utils.c}.  You will need to turn
  these in via webhandin.
  
  \item You'll want to rigorously test your functions to verify they
  are correct.  We've provided a starter test file, 
  \mintinline{text}{arrayUtilsTester.c} that you can use.  You 
  do not need to hand in this file.
  
  \item All functions should perform reasonable error checks and
  handling even though they are not returning error codes.  Ex:
  an invalid array cannot possibly hold an element $x$; functions
  that return a pointer can only return \mintinline{c}{NULL} for
  an error.
  
  \item You should test all your functions with an image using the
  image driver program we've provided.
  
  \item You should write/add documentation to all your functions
  \emph{first}. Use this as an opportunity to think/discuss how the 
  functions should work and
  to \emph{whiteboard} your designs and solutions with other students.
  
  \item You are encouraged to collaborate any number of students 
  before, during, and after your scheduled hack session.  

  \item You may (in fact are encouraged) to define any additional
  ``helper'' functions that may help you.

  \item Include the name(s) of everyone who worked together on
  this activity in your source file's header.

  \item Turn in the following files to the webhandin, making sure that 
  it runs and executes correctly in the webgrader.  Each individual 
  student will need to hand in their own copy and will receive 
  their own individual grade.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \mintinline{text}{array_utils.h} 
    \item \mintinline{text}{array_utils.c} 
    \item \mintinline{text}{imageUtils.h} 
    \item \mintinline{text}{imageUtils.c}
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
