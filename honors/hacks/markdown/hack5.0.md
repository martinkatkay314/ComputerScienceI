## Problem Statement

To get some practice designing and using methods, you will create a
small library of utility functions by implementing the following
functions with the given signatures and specified functionality.

1. `public static double degreesToRadians(double degree)` - Converts 
   degrees to radians using the formula:
     $$\frac{d\cdot \pi}{180}$$

2.  Write a method to compute the air distance between two locations
    identified by their latitude/longitude.

    ```java
    public static double getAirDistance(double originLatitude, 
                                        double originLongitude, 
                                        double destinationLatitude, 
                                        double destinationLongitude)
    ```
    The air distance between two latitude/longitude points can be
    calculated using the Spherical Law of Cosines:
    $$d = \arccos{(\sin(\varphi_1) \sin(\varphi_2) + \cos(\varphi_1) \cos(\varphi_2) \cos(\Delta) )} \cdot R$$
    where

    -   $\varphi_1$ is the latitude of location $A$, $\varphi_2$ is the
        latitude of location $B$

    -   $\Delta$ is the difference between location $B$'s longitude and
        location $A$'s longitude

    -   $R$ is the (average) radius of the earth, 6,371 kilometers

    Note: the formula above assumes that latitude and longitude are
    measured in radians $r$, $-\pi \leq r \leq \pi$, but the function
    will expect the latitude/longitude to be in degrees. Latitude should
    be in the range $[-90, 90]$ and longitude in the range
    $[-180, 180]$. Negative values correspond to the southern and
    western hemispheres.

3.  An object traveling at a velocity $v$ experiences time dilation
    relative to a stationary object which is quantified by the Lorentz
    equation: $$T = \frac{t}{\sqrt{(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2})}}$$ where $t$ is
    the normal amount of lapsed time (stationary object) and $T$ is the
    dilated time experienced by the traveling object. For small
    velocities, the dilation is small and imperceptible.  For 
    velocities approaching a substantial *percentage* of the speed 
    of light, $c$, the dilation becomes significant.

    For example, at 25% the speed of light, a year for the object
    traveling would correspond to 1.032796 years at the stationary
    object (or nearly 12 extra days). A person traveling at high
    velocity would experience "slowed" time relative to the stationary
    *frame*. Implement a function to compute the dilated time given the
    normal time $t$ (units may vary) and the percentage of the speed of
    light.

    `public static double lorentzTimeDilation(double t, double percentC)`

## Instructions

-   You are encouraged to collaborate any number of students before,
    during, and after your scheduled hack session.

-   Design at least 3 test cases for each function *before* you begin
    designing or implementing your program. Test cases are input-output
    pairs that are known to be correct using means other than your
    program.

-   Include the name(s) of everyone who worked together on this activity
    in your source file's header.

-   Place your methods with documentation in a source file named 
    `Utils.java`.

-   In addition, implement all of your test cases in a *test driver*
    file named `UtilsTester.java` which should output the expected output, the actual
    output and a message on whether or not the test case passed. You
    must have at least 3 test cases for *each* of your functions. You
    should *not* prompt for input or use command line arguments. Your
    test cases should be hardcoded in your test driver's `main()` method.
    
-   Turn in all of your files via webhandin, making sure that it runs
    and executes correctly in the webgrader. Each individual student
    will need to hand in their own copy and will receive their own
    individual grade.
