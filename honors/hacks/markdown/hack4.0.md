## Problem Statement

A 401(k) plan is a type of tax-qualified account for people to save for
retirement. Employees typically have part of their pre-tax pay check
deposited into such an account and employers may match a certain amount
of those contributions. As of 2018, there is a maximum annual
contribution limit of \$18,500.

The money contributed to a 401(k) account may be invested in many
different ways. While the account may grow tax free, it is not immune to
[inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation). To account 
for inflation, you can use the following formula
which is the inflation-adjusted rate of return.

$$\frac{1 + \textrm{rate of return}}{1+\textrm{inflation rate}} - 1$$

-->
</p>

Write a program that produces an *amortization table* for a 401(k)
account. Your program will read the following inputs as *command line
arguments*.

-   An initial starting balance

-   A monthly contribution amount (we'll assume its the same over the
    life of the savings plan)

-   An (average) annual rate of return (on the scale [0, 1])

-   An (average) annual rate of inflation (on the scale [0, 1])

-   A number of years until retirement

Your program will then compute a monthly savings table detailing the
(inflation-adjusted) interest earned each month, contribution, and new
balance. To get the monthly rate, simply divide by 12. Each month,
interest is applied to the balance at this rate (prior to the monthly
deposit) and the monthly contribution is added. Thus, the earnings
compound month to month. Be sure to round appropriately, to the nearest
cent so that rounding errors do not compound.

Your program will need to validate the input and quit with an error
message on any potential bad input(s). For inputs

your output should look something like the following:

```text
Month    Interest     Balance 
    1 $     64.23 $  10564.23
    2 $     67.85 $  11132.08
    3 $     71.50 $  11703.58
    4 $     75.17 $  12278.75
    5 $     78.87 $  12857.62
    6 $     82.58 $  13440.20
    7 $     86.33 $  14026.53
    8 $     90.09 $  14616.62
    9 $     93.88 $  15210.50
...    
  116 $    678.19 $ 106767.24
  117 $    685.76 $ 107953.00
  118 $    693.37 $ 109146.37
  119 $    701.04 $ 110347.41
  120 $    708.75 $ 111556.16
Total Interest Earned: $  41556.16
Total Nest Egg: $ 111556.16
```

## Instructions

-   You are encouraged to collaborate any number of students before,
    during, and after your scheduled hack session.

-   Design at least 3 test cases *before* you begin designing or
    implementing your program. Test cases are input-output pairs that
    are known to be correct using means other than your program.

-   Include the name(s) of everyone who collaborated on this activity
    in your source file's header.
    
-   Place your code in a `main()` method in a source file named
    `Retire.java` and turn it in via webhandin.  Make sure that
    it runs and executes correctly in the webgrader. Each individual
    student will need to hand in their own copy and will receive their
    own individual grade.
