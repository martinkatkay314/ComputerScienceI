## Problem Statement

In this hack you'll get some more practice writing functions that
utilize pass-by-reference (pointers), error handling and enumerated
types. There are several different ways to model colors including RGB
and CMYK. RGB is generally used in displays and models a color with
three values in the range [0, 255] corresponding to the red, green and
blue "contribution" to the color. For example, the triple
(255, 255, 0) corresponds to a full red and green (additive) value
which results in yellow. CMYK or Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black is a model
used in printing where four colors of ink are combined to make various
colors. In this system, the four values are on the scale [0, 1]. Write
functions to convert between these models.

1.  Write a function to convert from an RGB color model to CMYK. To
    convert to CMYK, you first need to scale each integer value to the
    range [0, 1] by computing
    <!-- $$r' = \frac{r}{255}, \quad g' = \frac{g}{255}, \quad b' = \frac{b}{255}$$ -->
    <p align="center">
    <img src="./images/rgb01.png" alt="Scaled RGB formulas" width="40%"/>
    </p>  
    and then using the following formulas: 
    <!--$$\begin{aligned}
    k & = 1-\max\{r', g', b'\} \\
    c & = \frac{(1-r'-k)}{(1-k)} \\
    m & = \frac{(1-g'-k)}{(1-k)} \\
    y & = \frac{(1-b'-k)}{(1-k)} \\\
    end{aligned}$$-->
    <p align="center">
    <img src="./images/convertRGBtoCMYK.png" alt="CMYK formulas" width="30%"/>
    </p>  
    
    Your method should have the following signature:
    
    `public static CMYK rgbToCMYK(RGB color)`

    Identify any and all error conditions and use the return value to
    indicate an error code (0 for no error, non-zero value(s) for error
    conditions). Note that one edge case is black, when
    (r,g,b) = (0,0,0) which would lead to a division by zero in the
    formulas. The equivalent CMYK values are (0,0,0,1).

2.  Write a function to convert from CMYK to RGB using the following
    formulas. 
    <!--
    $$\begin{aligned}
    r & = 255 \cdot (1 - c) \cdot (1-k) \\
    g & = 255 \cdot (1 - m) \cdot (1-k) \\
    b & = 255 \cdot (1 - y) \cdot (1-k) \\\end{aligned}$$ 
    -->
    <p align="center">
    <img src="./images/convertCMYKtoRGB.png" alt="RGB formulas" width="30%"/>
    </p>  

    All results should be rounded. Your function should have the 
    following signature:
    
    `public static RGB cmykToRGB(CMYK color)`

The `RGB` and `CMYK` classes have been provided for you.  See
the `main` method of each class for examples on how to create
and use *instances* of each class.

Place both methods in a source file named `ColorUtils.java`
in the package `unl.cse`.  For both methods, identify any and 
all error conditions and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` 
with an appropriate error message.

## Instructions

-   You are encouraged to collaborate any number of students before,
    during, and after your scheduled hack session.

-   Design at least 3 test cases for each function *before* you begin
    designing or implementing your program. Test cases are input-output
    pairs that are known to be correct using means other than your
    program.

-   You may (in fact are encouraged) to define any additional "helper"
    functions that you find useful.

-   Include the name(s) of everyone who worked together on this activity
    in your source file's header.

TODO: here

-   A testing file, has been provided that uses cmocka
    (<https://cmocka.org/>), a unit testing framework for C. We have
    already written several (17) test cases for you. Using these
    examples, implement your test cases using cmocka for your two
    functions. You should have at least 3 test cases for each function
    for a total of 23 test cases.

    The starter file should be sufficient to demonstrate how to use
    cmocka, but the full documentation can be found here:
    <https://api.cmocka.org/>. A has also been provided to help you
    easily compile your files. Note that cmocka is already installed on
    the CSE server. If you compile on your own machine, you will have to
    install and troubleshoot cmocka yourself.

-   Turn in all of your files via webhandin, making sure that it runs
    and executes correctly in the webgrader. Each individual student
    will need to hand in their own copy and will receive their own
    individual grade.
