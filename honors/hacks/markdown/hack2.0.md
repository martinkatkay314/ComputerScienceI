## Problem Statement

Consider two locations on the globe, an origin and a destination,
identified by their latitude and longitude. The distance between these
two locations can be computed using the [Spherical Law of Cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_law_of_cosines). The distance $d$ is

$$d = \arccos{(\sin(\varphi_1) \sin(\varphi_2) + \cos(\varphi_1) \cos(\varphi_2) \cos(\Delta) )} \cdot R$$
where

-   $\varphi_1$ is the latitude of location $A$, $\varphi_2$ is the
    latitude of location $B$

-   $\Delta$ is the difference between location $B$'s longitude and
    location $A$'s longitude

-   $R$ is the (average) radius of the earth, 6,371 kilometers

Write a program that *prompts* the user to enter the latitude and
longitude of two locations and then computes the distance between them
using the above formula. The latitude inputs will be in degrees
and in the range $[-90, 90]$ and longitude will be in degrees in the
range $[-180, 180]$. Negative values correspond to the western and
southern hemispheres.

The formula above assumes that latitude and longitude are
measured in radians $r$, $-\pi \leq r \leq \pi$. You can convert from
degrees $deg$ to radians $r$ using the formula
$$r = \frac{deg}{180} \cdot \pi$$

Your output should look something like the following.

``` {.text}
Location Distance
========================
Origin:      (41.948300, -87.655600)
Destination: (40.820600, -96.705600)
Air distance is 764.990931 kms
```

## Instructions

-   You are encouraged to collaborate with any number of students before,
    during, and after your scheduled hack session.

-   Design at least 3 test cases *before* you begin designing or
    implementing your program. Test cases are input-output pairs that
    are known to be correct using means other than your program.

-   Include the name(s) of everyone who collaborated on this activity
    in your source file's header.

-   Place your code in a `main()` method in a source file named
    `AirDistance.java` and turn it in via webhandin.  Make sure that
    it runs and executes correctly in the webgrader. Each individual
    student will need to hand in their own copy and will receive their
    own individual grade.

-   Remember to RTM (Read The Manual) on Java's `Math` class/library 
    to see which function(s) you may find useful and how to use them.
