> "If you really want to understand something, the best way is to try

> you've sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a
> stupid machine can deal with, you've certainly learned something about
> it yourself."
>
> —Douglas Adams, *Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency*

> In my experience, you assert control over a computer–show it who's the
> boss–by making it do something unique. That means programming it... If
> you devote a couple of hours to programming a new machine, you'll feel
> better about it ever afterwards"

## Skills Objectives

This course has several learning objectives and "skills objectives."
These are the skills that, upon successful completion of this course,
you should be able to exhibit.

-   You should have a mastery of the fundamentals of programming in a
    high-level language, including data types and rudimentary data
    structures, control flow, repetition, selection, input/output, and
    procedures and functions.

-   You should be able to approach a reasonably complex problem, design
    a top-down solution, and code a program in a high-level programming
    language that automates solutions.

-   You should have a familiarity with problem solving methods,
    including problem analysis, requirements and specifications, design,
    decomposition and step-wise refinement, and algorithm development
    (including recursion).

-   You should have a familiarity with software development principles
    and practices, including data and operation abstraction,
    encapsulation, modularity, code and artifact reuse, prototyping,
    iterative development, best practices in coding design, style, and
    documentation, a good understanding of proper testing and debugging
    techniques and a familiarity with development tools.

-   You should have exposure to algorithms for searching, sorting and
    other problems, graphical user interfaces, event-driven programming,
    and database access.

-   You should have a foundation for further software development and
    exploration. You should have a deep enough understanding of at least
    one high-level programming language that you should be able to learn
    another programming language with relative ease in a relatively
    short amount of time.

## Grading

Assessment (grading) will be based on readings, labs, "hacks", a
semester project and two exams with the following point distributions.

|  Category           | Number | Points Each | Total |
|  -------------------|--------|-------------|-------|
|  Starter Points     |        |             |     15|
|  Attendance         |      13|           10|    130|
|  Labs               |      12|           15|    180|
|  Hacks              |      13|           25|    325|
|  Midterm            |       1|          100|    100|
|  Project or Final   |       1|          150|    150|
|  Total              |        |             |    900|


### Starter Points

It is important to start out positively. Put yourself in the mindset
that you *will* succeed in this course and commit yourself to putting in
a full effort in every aspect of it. To get you started, we're giving
you **free starter points**. You have a perfect score in this course already!
Keep it up!

### Modules

The material for this course is separated into a number of modules, each
covering a major topic and each subsequent module building on the
skills and knowledge from prior ones.  Each module has three graded
components: attendance at your weekly lab/hack session, a lab, and
a "hack".

### Attendance

#### Lecture

All lectures are livestreamed via YouTube and recordings are available
immediately after. A live Q&A through Piazza is available during lecture
as well.  Though we will livestream and record letures, regular,
in-person attendance for lectures is *highly recommended*.  Simply
attending is not enough to succeed however.  You need to be engaged, be
prepared to ask (and answer) questions, and actively take notes.  
Research has conclusively shown that the simple act of taking notes helps
with comprehension and retention of material.  

#### Lab/Hack Sessions

As a skills-based course, learning this material requires you to put it
into practice.  Each Friday, a 2.5 hour lab/hack session is held.  You
will have the opportunity to be teamed up with another student during
these sessions to work on your lab and hack for that week.  Learning
Assistants will also be in attendance to guide you and answer questions.
This is an invaluable opportunity to complete your lab and get a good
start on your hack.  

To ensure participation your attendance **and** engagement in these
lab/hack sessions will be graded.  Each session will be worth 10
points (roughly 1% of your final grade).  To earn the full 10 points
you must:

  * Attend the full session -- do not be more than 10 minutes late, do
    not leave more than 10 minutes early
  * Put forth a full effort -- you must work on the lab/hack for that
    week or for other material in the course; you may not work on
    other material or remain idle
  * You may only leave the lab/hack session early if you have already
    completed both the lab and hack for that module.

**Alternative**

It is understandable that you may not be able to attend every lab/hack
session or that your background or approach to this material means you
don't need the structured environment that the lab/hack session provides.
As an alternative, *if you can prove yourself capable* of completing
labs and hacks on your own you may choose not to attend the lab/hack session.

If you attend as outlined above, you get the full 10 points.  If you
choose not to attend, you may still earn the 10 points ***provided***
that you earn at least 30/40 of the remaining points for each module
(15 points for the lab + 25 points for the hack).  If you do not attend
and you earn less than 30/40 points for the module, you will get a zero
for the attendance portion of the module.

#### Continuation of Instruction

If in-person classes are canceled by the University during a lecture
day, lecture will still be livestreamed.  If in-person classes are canceled
by the University during a lab/hack day, in-person attendance will not be
required, help will be made available via zoom and you will still be
expected to complete the work remotely.

### Labs

Weekly labs give you hands-on exercises for topics
recently covered in lecture. The purpose of lab is not only to give you
further working experience with lecture topics, but also to provide you
with additional information and details not necessarily covered in
lecture. Each lab will have some programming exercises and may have
a supplemental worksheet.

During the lab/hack session, you may be randomly
paired with a partner. One of you will be the *driver* and the other
will be the *navigator*. The navigator will be responsible for reading
the instructions and guiding the driver. The driver will be in charge of
the keyboard and will type the code. Both driver and navigator are
responsible for developing and working through solutions together.
Neither the navigator nor the driver is "in charge," it is an equal
partnership. Beyond your immediate pairing, you are encouraged to help
and interact and with other pairs in the lab.

Each lab is assessed based on completion. In general you will need to
submit code and an electronic writeup of your worksheet (plain text or
markdown is preferred) through webhandin which can also be verified
using the webgrader. You will have until midnight on the day of the lab
to submit your solutions. Points will be awarded based on the
results of the webgrader.

### Hacks

Assuming you have prepared for each lab/hack session, labs are
designed to be completed in 1.5 hours.  During the remainder of
your time, you will start on your weekly hack assignment.  
Hacks generally involve more substantial programming exercises
than labs and you are not expected to complete them during the
hack session.  Instead, they are generally due the following
week (see Canvas for due dates).  

You may complete hacks on your own, but you are encouraged to
pair up and collaborate with (**at most**) one other student.
If you choose to pair up with another student, you must form
a pair using canvas (People -> Hack Pairs).

### Midterm

There will be one midterm exam which will consist of live
coding exercises for which you will need your own
machine as you will be coding and submitting programs online for
grading. More details will be announced closer to the exam date.
No collaboration is allowed on the midterm.

### Final Project/Final Exam

At the end of the semester for your remaining 150 points, you will
have a choice: a substantial Hack/Project or sitting for a cumulative
final examination.  You must choose one or the other.  No collaboration
is allowed for either option.

#### Final Project

The end-of-semester programming project involves a Hack that has
you perform a series of data processing reports.  The project would
be due by the final examination date/time.

#### Final Exam

The final will be a cumulative examination that will consist of
live coding exercises for which you will need your own
machine as you will be coding and submitting programs online for
grading. More details will be announced closer to the exam date.

### Scale

Final letter grades will be awarded based on the following standard
scale. This scale may be adjusted upwards if the instructor deems it
necessary based on the final grades only. No scale will be made for
individual assignments or exams.

| Letter Grade | Percent |
|--------------|---------|
| A+           | >= 97%  |
| A            | >= 93%  |
| A-           | >= 90%  |
| B+           | >= 87%  |
| B            | >= 83%  |
| B-           | >= 80%  |
| C+           | >= 77%  |
| C            | >= 73%  |
| C-           | >= 70%  |
| D+           | >= 67%  |
| D            | >= 63%  |
| D-           | >= 60%  |
| F            | < 60%   |

### Grading Policy

If you have questions about grading or believe that points were deducted
unfairly, you must first address the issue with the individual who
graded it to see if it can be resolved. Such questions should be made
within a reasonable amount of time after the graded assignment has been
returned. No further consideration will be given to any assignment a
week after it grades have been posted. It is important to emphasize that
the goal of grading is consistency. A grade on any given assignment,
even if it is low for the entire class, should not matter that much.
Rather, students who do comparable work should receive comparable grades
(see the subsection on the scale used for this course).

### Late Work Policy

In general, there will be no make-up exams or late work accepted.
Exceptions may be made in certain circumstances such as health or
emergency, but you must make every effort to get prior permission.
Documentation may also be required.

Assignments have a strict due date/time as defined by the CSE
server's system clock. All program files must be handed in using CSE's
webhandin as specified in individual assignment handouts. Programs that
are even a few seconds past the due date/time will be considered late
and you will be locked out of handing anything in after that time.

### Webgrader Policy

Failure to adhere to the requirements of an assignment in such a manner
that makes it impossible to grade your program via the webgrader means
that a disproportionate amount of time would be spent evaluating your
assignment. For this reason, we will not grade any assignment that does
not compile and run through the webgrader.


## Academic Integrity

All homework assignments, programs, and exams must represent your own
work unless otherwise stated. No collaboration with fellow students,
past or current, is allowed unless otherwise permitted on specific
assignments or problems. The Department of Computer Science &
Engineering has an Academic Integrity Policy. All students enrolled in
any computer science course are bound by this policy. You are expected
to read, understand, and follow this policy. Violations will be dealt
with on a case by case basis and may result in a failing assignment or a
failing grade for the course itself. The most recent version of the
Academic Integrity Policy can be found at
<https://computing.unl.edu/academic-integrity-policy>

## Communication & Getting Help

The primary means of communication for this course is Piazza, an online
forum system designed for college courses. We have established a Piazza
group for this course and you should have received an invitation to
join. If you have not, contact the instructor immediately. With Piazza
you can ask questions anonymously, remain anonymous to your classmates,
or choose to be identified. Using this open forum system the entire
class benefits from the instructor and TA responses. In addition, you
and other students can also answer each other's questions (again you may
choose to remain anonymous or identify yourself to the instructors or
everyone). You may still email the instructor or TAs, but more than
likely you will be redirected to Piazza for help.

In addition, there are two anonymous suggestion boxes that you may use
to voice your concerns about any problems in the course if you do not
wish to be identified. My personal box is available on the course
webpage. The department also maintains an anonymous suggestion box
available at <https://computing.unl.edu/anonymous-department-feedback-form>.

### Getting Help

Your success in this course is ultimately your responsibility. Your
success in this course depends on how well you utilize the opportunities
and resources that we provide. There are numerous outlets for learning
the material and getting help in this course:

-   Lectures: attend lectures regularly and when you do use the time
    appropriately. Do not distract yourself with social media or other
    time wasters. Actively take notes (electronic or hand written). It
    is well-documented that good note taking directly leads to
    understanding and retention of concepts.

-   Lecture Videos: Lecture videos are intended as a supplement that
    mirrors lecture material but that may not cover everything. Watch
    them at your own pace on a regular basis for reiteration or in case
    you missed something in lecture.

-   Required Reading: do the required reading on a regular basis. The
    readings provide additional details and depth that you may not
    necessarily get directly in lecture.

-   Labs & Hack Sessions: use your time during lab and hack sessions
    wisely. Engage with your lab instructors, teaching assistants, your
    partner(s) and other students. Be sure to adequately prepare for
    labs by reading the handouts before coming to lab. Get started and
    don't get distracted.

-   Piazza: if you have questions ask them on Piazza. It is the best and
    likely fastest way to get help with your questions. Also, be sure to
    read other student's posts and questions and feel free to answer
    yourself!

-   Office Hours: the instructor and teaching
    assistants hold regular office hours throughout the week as posted
    on the course website. Attend office hours if you have questions or
    want to review material. 

-   Don't procrastinate. The biggest reason students fail this course is
    because they do not give themselves enough opportunities to learn
    the material. Don't wait to the last minute to start your
    assignments. Many people wait to the last minute and flood the TAs
    and SRC, making it difficult to get help as the due date approaches.
    Don't underestimate how much time your assignment(s) will take and
    don't wait to the week before hand to get started. Ideally, you
    should be working on the problems as we are covering them.

-   Get help in the *right way*: when you go to the instructor or TA for
    help, you must demonstrate that you have put forth a good faith
    effort toward understanding the material. Asking questions that
    clearly indicate you have failed to read the required material, have
    not been attending lecture, etc. is *not acceptable*. Don't ask
    generic questions like "I'm lost, I don't know what I'm doing".
    Instead, explain what you have tried so far. Explain why you think
    what you have tried doesn't seem to be working. Then the TA will
    have an easier time to help you identify misconceptions or problems.
    This is known as "Rubber Duck Debugging" where in if you try to
    explain a problem to someone (or, lacking a live person, a rubber
    duck), then you can usually identify the problem yourself. Or, at
    the very least, get some insight as to what might be wrong.
